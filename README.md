# React + Vite + Router

**Routing** is like giving directions to different parts of a website. When you click a link on a website, it takes you to a different page—this process is called routing. **React** helps you navigate between different "pages" without reloading the entire website.

In React, routing is dynamic, meaning that even though you're switching between "pages," your web app doesn't reload the whole page each time—only the part that changes gets updated.

### Types of Routes

1. **Public Routes:**
   - These pages are open for everyone to see.
   - No need to log in to access them.
   - Example: Homepage, Contact Us, or About Us page.

2. **Private Routes:**
   - These are pages you can only see if you’re logged in.
   - Example: A personal profile or dashboard.
   - If you're not logged in, it will take you to the login page first.

3. **Protected Routes:**
   - These are like private routes, but with an extra layer of security.
   - Only specific users (with special roles like admin or manager) can access these pages.
   - Example: Admin Dashboard, where only authorized users can make changes to the system.

### How React Router Helps
React Router is a tool that allows us to set up these kinds of routes in a React app, making it easy to move between different pages or parts of the app without needing to refresh the entire page.
